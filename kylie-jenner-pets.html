It was an English Bulldog puppy named Rolly. The puppy came from Shrinkabulls.com which is known for providing celebrities with unique and very expensive breeds. Dogs from Shrinkabulls.com fall in the price range between $3,000 to $30,000 each. But, when Jenner posted Rolly on Snapchat she included dollar signs and the caption “50K.” Is that how much the dog was? He’s adorably scrunchy-faced and has tri-color spots, as a Merle English Bulldog.</p><p>Later that year, Kylie reported that the dog did not belong to her. It looks like the initial posts may have been from a short term visit. Or, perhaps the price tag was a little too pricey and they returned the dog.</p><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/video_image-409612-195x195.jpg alt="Kylie Jenner's pet Norman" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 250px,195px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h3 class=single__pet-summary__name>Norman (Dog)</h3><span class=single__pet-summary__meta><span class=single__pet-summary__type>Breed: Italian miniature greyhound</span> | <span class=single__pet-summary__date>Adopted Dec 2014</span></span><p>Kylie had said publicly several times that she always wanted an Italian greyhound. During Christmas 2014 she got her wish with Norman, a grey Italian Greyhound. Norman and Bambi are Kylie’s most popular dogs, and have their own Instagram accounts. Norman is affectionately known as “Normi” by Kylie and had one of the biggest dog birthday bashes ever for his first birthday. In 2016, Kylie had to miss the American Music Awards because Norman and Bambi had two surprise puppies!</p><span class=single__post-summary__social__label>More Norman</span><ul class=single__post-summary__social__value><li><a href=# title="Kylie Jenner's Dog 's Instagram" class=track__profile_meta_instagram><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/themes/cpw_live/images/instagram_pink.svg?x38408 alt="Norman Instagram" fetchpriority=high style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></li></ul><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sophia-Kylie-Jenner-195x195.jpg alt="Kylie Jenner's pet Sophia" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 250px,195px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h3 class=single__pet-summary__name>Sophia (Dog)</h3><span class=single__pet-summary__meta><span class=single__pet-summary__type>Breed: Italian miniature greyhound</span> | <span class=single__pet-summary__date>Adopted Sep 2015</span></span><p>Sofia is the third Italian greyhound added to Kylie’s collection, which she revealed in September 2015 on her Spanchat.

The pig was named Wilbur by Kris and it’s unknown if Kylie kept or changed his name. When Kris first gave her the piglet, you can hear Kylie ask, “Is that a chicken?” in the video. Either she was so excited about the baby pig that she forgot what pigs were, or she has a difficult time telling farm animals apart. Since then, Kylie has followed up with this explanation, “Everyone keeps tweeting me this one Vine of my mom getting me a pig, and I mistake it for a chicken,” Kylie said on her Snapchat story in 2016. “But here’s the real story behind me thinking that it’s a chicken. So I love chickens. My mom asked me what I wanted for my housewarming gift, and I told her I want chickens. I want a chicken coop. I’m, like, dying to have a chicken. We had, like, over 10 conversations about it, so when I saw her downstairs with something all wrapped up in her arms, and I was upstairs, of course, I assumed that it was a f*cking chicken.”</p><p>Wilbur was re-homed, as he didn’t actually like the Jenner-Kardashians.</p><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kendall-Jenner-Louis-Vuitton-195x195.jpg alt="Kylie Jenner's pet Louis & Vuitton" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 250px,195px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h3 class=single__pet-summary__name>Louis & Vuitton (Dog)</h3><span class=single__pet-summary__meta><span class=single__pet-summary__type>Breed: Chocolate Labs</span> | <span class=single__pet-summary__date>Adopted 2011</span></span><p>Louis and Vuitton were two chocolate labradors that Kendall and Kylie got as Christmas gifts in 2011 from Kris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner.

Apparently, Wesley was seen poking around Jenner’s house in a few Instagram stories and cuddling with Jenner, indicating that she got custody of the pup in the friend-divorce, which makes sense, considering Jordyn Woods was living in her house when they adopted the dog together.

They led to many people thinking that she has a Greyhound named Jack, and with the number of Greyhounds she had, we can’t blame anyone for mixing them up (unless they also did an hour or so of research just to figure this out like me…)</p><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kylie-Jenner-Silkie-Bantam-Chicken-named-Eddie-April-2017-195x195.jpg alt="Kylie Jenner's pet Eddie" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 250px,195px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h3 class=single__pet-summary__name>Eddie (Chicken)</h3><span class=single__pet-summary__meta><span class=single__pet-summary__type>Breed: Silkie</span> | <span class=single__pet-summary__date>Adopted Apr 2017</span></span><p>Kylie Jenner has a Silkie Bantam Chicken named Eddie that she got in April 2017.

Jenner was revealed as the buyer via the breeder, @stalwilten, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted the horse to Instagram</a> and mentioned Kylie and Stormi. It was estimated to cost an additional $7,000 to $10,000 to fly the horse from the Netherlands to Los Angeles. The huge price tag coupled with the fact that Storm, only two years old at the time, wouldn’t be able to ride it for years, caused some controversy across social media. After the controversy, @stalwilten removed the reference to the Jenners.</p><p>ThrowbackThursday goes to the most famous pony of them all – Frozen – We got news he has landed in L.A. and living the life with a sweet little girl named Stormi. @kyliejenner in true fashion, made sure her daughter had the most precious pony out there.

Kylie grew up on the screen, and her candid depiction of adolescence struck a chord with viewers around the world. At the same time, Jenner made astute use of social media platforms, cultivating an enormous online following. This influence would later serve as a launchpad for her entrepreneurial endeavors. In 2015, she founded Kylie Cosmetics, introducing the now-iconic Kylie Lip Kit. Her makeup company rapidly grew into a cosmetics empire, with Forbes reporting it valued at nearly $900 million in 2019. In 2020, she delved into skincare, launching Kylie Skin, which further expanded her footprint in the beauty industry.</p><p>Jenner’s success is partially attributed to her knack for collaborations with other celebrities and influencers. She’s worked closely with her sisters, Kim Kardashian West and Kendall Jenner, to launch products under Kylie Cosmetics. In the realm of fashion, Kylie partnered with fashion house Balmain for a makeup collection in 2019. She also leveraged her massive online influence to promote brands like Puma and Adidas.</p><p>Over the course of her career, Jenner’s business acumen and influential status have brought her recognition in various forms. Forbes named her the youngest self-made billionaire in 2019, a testament to her success with Kylie Cosmetics. Her social media influence is also undeniable, with TIME including her in their list of “The 30 Most Influential Teens” for consecutive years 2014, 2015, and 2016.</p><p>Kendall is also known for her relationship with rapper <a href=#>Travis Scott</a>, who she has two children with named Stormi and Aire Webster.

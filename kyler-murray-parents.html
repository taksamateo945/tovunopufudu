Korean?</span></h2><p>Misun (Missy) Henderson is Kyler Murray’s mother, a proud Korean-American born on September 25, 1964.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CAA-Mnlpmw2/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p><p>She is of mixed Korean heritage and is the daughter of <a href=#><strong>US Navy</strong></a> officer Msgt Carl W Henderson Sr.</p><p>Unfortunately, her mother’s name remains undisclosed, but it is known that she is of African descent.</p><p>Missy crossed paths with Kyler’s father, Kevin Murray, during their time as students at <a href=#><strong>Texas A&M University</strong></a>.</p><p>Their union took place in 1995, resulting in the birth of two sons, Kyler and Kevin Jr.</p><p>Throughout Kyler’s life, Missy has been a source of unwavering support and affection.</p><p>He consistently expresses his deep appreciation for his Korean heritage.</p><p>In late 2018, Kyler paid tribute to his mother’s culture by donning a kimono jacket adorned with a black dragon design.</p><p>Additionally, he proudly displays the South Korean flag on his helmet as a heartfelt homage to both his mother and grandmother.</p><p>In her professional life, Missy serves as a business manager and holds the position of an executive assistant.</p><h2><span id=What_Nationality_Is_Kyler_Murray_Mom>What Nationality

id=Who_Is_Kyler_Murray_Dad>Who Is Kyler Murray Dad?</span></h2><p>Kyler Murray’s father goes by the name of Kevin Murray, and he had a notable career as a former American football quarterback while attending Texas A&M University.</p><p>Born on June 18, 1964, in <a href=#><strong>Dallas, Texas,</strong></a> he is the son of Charles Murray Sr. and Virginia Murray and identifies as African-American.</p><p>During his high school years, Kevin Murray displayed exceptional athleticism, excelling in both baseball and football.</p><p>In 1982, he was selected in the 11th round of the MLB draft by the Milwaukee Brewers and played a single season for their Pikeville rookie league team.</p><p>However, he eventually shifted his focus to football while at Texas A&M, where he made quite an impact.</p><p>Over four seasons, he amassed impressive stats, including 6,506 passing yards and 48 touchdowns, earning him the distinction of being a two-time second-team All-American and leading his team to two Southwest Conference championships.</p><p>Unfortunately, Kevin’s dreams of a sustained professional football career were derailed by a knee injury that prevented him from getting drafted into the NFL.</p><p>He had brief stints with the <a href=#><strong>San Francisco 49ers</strong></a> and the Calgary Stampeders before ultimately retiring from the sport.</p><p>After retiring, he pursued a career in human resources management and also became a football coach.</p><p>Kevin played a pivotal role in his son Kyler’s development as a quarterback.</p><p>He started teaching Kyler the art of throwing the football when Kyler was just seven years old.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CBtBAvBJJkW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p><p>Since then, he has continued to serve as Kyler’s mentor and trainer, playing a significant role in Kyler’s football journey.</p><p>Kevin is known for being very protective of his son and prefers to maintain a low profile, staying away from the limelight.</p><p>He seldom attends Kyler’s games and tends to avoid media interviews, preferring to support his son from behind the scenes.</p><h2><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>Kyler Murray, a talented and charismatic quarterback with a bright future, hails from a supportive, diverse family.</p><p>His parents, Kevin Murray and Missy Henderson, are former athletes and college graduates.</p><p>Kyler, who proudly embraces his African-American and half-Korean heritage, is recovering from a torn ACL last season but is expected to lead the Cardinals to glory soon.</p><h3><span

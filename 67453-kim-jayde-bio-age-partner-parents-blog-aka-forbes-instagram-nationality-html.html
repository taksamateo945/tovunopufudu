After moving to South Africa in 2009, she began her modeling career.

She was rejected continuously and would attend up to three modeling casts in a day and would receive a no.</p><p class=align-left>Speaking to ZAlebs, she recalls that things had gotten so bad that she could not afford basic needs like food, and she had to strategically visit modeling agencies during the lunch hours so that she could get her meal for the day. She would also walk to the agency since she had no fare, and she realized that she could not rely on modeling alone to pay her bills.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Nomzamo Mbatha bio: age, boyfriend, mother, sister and Isibaya</p><p class=align-left>She then became a hostess and started doing promo work to make a living until she worked her way to the top.

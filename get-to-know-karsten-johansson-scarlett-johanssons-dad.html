A better part of his life story today is being told from the narrative of his famous daughter, but there are still many things to know about the man.</p><h3><b>Summary of Karsten Johansson’s Bio&nbsp;</b></h3><ul><li><b>Full name: </b>Karsten Johansson</li><li><b>Gender:</b> Male</li><li><b>Date of birth:&nbsp;</b>2 October 1943</li><li><b><strong>Karsten Johansson</strong>’s Age: </b>80 years old</li><li><b>Ethnicity:</b> White</li><li><b>Nationality: </b>Danish and American</li><li><b>Zodiac Sign:&nbsp;</b>Libra</li><li><b>Sexual Orientation:&nbsp;</b>Straight</li><li><b>Religion:&nbsp;</b>Christianity</li><li><b>Marital Status:</b> Divorced</li><li><b><strong>Karsten Johansson</strong>’s Wife:</b> Melanie Sloan</li><li><b><strong>Karsten Johansson</strong>’s Children:&nbsp;</b>Christian Johansson, Vanessa Johansson, Hunter Johansson, Scarlett Johansson, and Adrian Johansson</li><li><b>Famous for:&nbsp;</b>Being Scarlett Johansson’s dad</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Karsten Johansson?</strong></h2><p>Karsten Johansson is 80 years old and was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2 October 1943. He was brought up in his home country, where he got his education and started his career as an Architect before he decided to move to the United States in search of better opportunities.</p><p>Of Danish nationality and white ethnicity, details about his childhood and other family members are not known. However, it is known that before he left Denmark, Karsten was once married, and he had a son named Christian. Christian stayed back in Denmark with his mom when his dad left for the United States.</p><p>Karsten migrated to the United States when he was 27 years old, and it was there that he struggled until he made something out of his life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/07/Scarlett-Johansson-family-1.jpg><h2><strong>Karsten Johansson and Melanie Sloan Were Married For 22 Years</strong></h2><p>Five years after he moved to the United States, Scarlett Johansson’s dad got married to Melanie Sloan, an American woman with Polish ancestry, in 1975.</p><p>Although things were very difficult for the couple at first, they still managed to have a great marriage for many years. Among other things, Karsten and his wife had issues with finances, but with so much effort, Melanie found a way of getting the couple’s daughter, Scarlett, to actively begin a career in Hollywood at the age of 11.</p><p>22 years after their marriage which was blessed with five kids, the pair decided it was time for them to end things. They divorced in 1997 because of what <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Scarlett described as</a> “good reasons.” According to the actress, her parents were having too many rows, and she believed it was better for them to go their separate ways.</p><h2><strong>Karsten Johansson and Melanie Sloan Had</strong> <strong>Scarlett Johansson in 1984</strong></h2><p>Johansson and Slaon welcomed their daughter, Scarlett Ingrid Johansson, on 22 November 1984, 9 years after their marriage. The 39-year-old <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>actress</a> was born in Manhattan, New York, which means her nationality is American, although she has Polish and Danish ethnicity.</p><p>Because of the difficulties encountered by the family, her mother decided to get her daughter to become an actress. She tried by looking for gigs in commercials, TV shows, or films, but all these failed. Sloan decided the best thing to do was to send her daughter to Professional Children’s School, and this was what helped her to start acting in 1994 when she got a role in the fantasy comedy North (1994).</p><p>Two years later, she made her big break when she appeared in Manny & Lo. In the years that followed, the Academy-nominated actress appeared in many successful productions, including Lost in Translation (2004), Match Point (2005), A View from the Bridge (2010), Under the Skin (2014), and The Avengers: Age of Ultron (2016).</p><p>Following the divorce between her parents, which came when the actress and her twin brother were only 13 years old, the kids remained in the care of their father in Manhattan while<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external> their mother moved</a> to Los Angeles.</p><h2><b>The Couple also Had Four Other Children Together</b></h2><p>Although Scarlett Johansson is the most famous of all of Karsten Johansson’s children, she is not his only child. The Danish-born architect had four more additional children with Melanie, namely Christian Johansson, Vanessa Johansson, Hunter Johansson, and Adrian Johansson.</p><p>The oldest child of the family is Adrian Johansson, who was born on November 3, 1976, which makes him 47 years old. He was born in New York City, New York. While he has mostly maintained a private life, Adrian is an actor who got his first acting role in the 1999 production Red Light August. His other known works are the film Rain (2001) and voicing for the games Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned (2009) and Red Dead Redemption (2010).</p><p>The second child of Karsten Johansson and Melanie Sloan is Vanessa Johansson. The 43 years old was born on January 12, 1980, in New York and has since started a career in Hollywood as an actress. Vanessa has appeared in many films and TV productions, including Manny & Lo (1996), Shark in Venice (2008), and the short film Screen Time (2020).</p><p>Coming after Vanessa is Christian Johansson, whose exact date of birth is not known. However, he has also had a stint in Hollywood as a writer and cinematographer.</p><p>Scarlett’s twin, Hunter Johansson, is the next member of the family. He was born together with the famous actress on November 22, 1984, which means the two are now 39 years old. Hunter and Scarlett started their career when they appeared in Manny & Lo. However, Scarlett has grown to become more famous than her brother, who has not been very active in the movie industry.</p><h3><b>Scarlett Johansson Has A Good Relationship With Her Dad</b></h3><p>The greater support that Scarlett needed in her career as an actress was gotten from her mom. Melanie did everything in her will to see that her daughter was successful. However, the actress also has a very good relationship with her dad, whom she has also helped and supported along the line, including after the divorce when her mother left.</p><p>After the actress got her place in Los Angeles and she had to spend less time with her dad, he did not mind refurbishing the apartment for her.</p><p>Many years after the divorce between her parents, it was reported that the actress was cutting off all financial support to her mom, but she still continued supporting her father. One of the main reasons why she was stopping any form of support for her mom was because of the extravagant life that Melanie Sloan has chosen. On the other hand, the actress was happy<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external> to keep supporting</a> her father because he did not try to live above his means.</p><p>Even at that, the actress remains ever grateful to her mum and dad for not only supporting her but also for not taking advantage of her when she was a child star. With several cases of celebrity kids who have suffered financial ruin at the hands of their parents, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>she stated that</a> her parents took care of her and they ensured that she also got her education and time off, which has helped her.</p><h2><strong>Scarlett Johansson’s Dad Once Worked As An Architect</strong></h2><p>Scarlett Johansson’s dad has most often been referred to as an actor, but more than that, he has worked as an architect. The exact period in which he started his career as an architect and how far he went with it has not been made known.</p><p>The better part of his career that is known is when he worked as an actor for a very brief period. His work in Hollywood was a very brief one, and he has only been credited with the 1996 film Manny & Lo, in which he appeared together with his other family members.</p><h2><strong>Where is Karsten Johansson Now?</strong></h2><p>Karsten currently lives in the United States. Although it is in public records that after his marriage came to an end, his wife proceeded to get married to Gilles Arondeau; even though the marriage <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>came to an end,</a> Karsten does not seem to have gotten married a second time.</p><p>The Danish-born has suffered some health challenges in the past. One of his well-known health scares came in 2011 when he was reported to have collapsed and was hospitalized for it. The incident, which had him hospitalized for some time, happened when he was walking on a street near his Manhattan apartment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLSmwIytpmajnqTEbrfAq6qtnZ5it7C0wKeqrKeeYsCkrdGlnK2sXZ%2B8qa3NrKqopqNisaKwjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fget-to-know-karsten-johansson-scarlett-johanssons-dad.html&text=Get%20to%20Know%20Karsten%20Johansson%2c%20Scarlett%20Johansson%27s%20Dad&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fget-to-know-karsten-johansson-scarlett-johanssons-dad.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fget-to-know-karsten-johansson-scarlett-johanssons-dad.html&title=Get%20to%20Know%20Karsten%20Johansson%2c%20Scarlett%20Johansson%27s%20Dad" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fget-to-know-karsten-johansson-scarlett-johanssons-dad.html&title=Get%20to%20Know%20Karsten%20Johansson%2c%20Scarlett%20Johansson%27s%20Dad" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fget-to-know-karsten-johansson-scarlett-johanssons-dad.html&title=Get%20to%20Know%20Karsten%20Johansson%2c%20Scarlett%20Johansson%27s%20Dad" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fget-to-know-karsten-johansson-scarlett-johanssons-dad.html&description=Get%20to%20Know%20Karsten%20Johansson%2c%20Scarlett%20Johansson%27s%20Dad" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10116600-report-lsus-hailey-van-lith-to-visit-mississippi-st-after-entering-transfer-portal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Report: LSU's Hailey Van Lith to Visit Mississippi St. After Entering Transfer Portal | News, Scores">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vicious-crossword-clue-1060720.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vicious Crossword Clue">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

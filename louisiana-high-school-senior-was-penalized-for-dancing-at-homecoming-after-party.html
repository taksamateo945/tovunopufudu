She was totally shocked,” the student’s mother, Rachel Timonet, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told </a>the Advocate. “He told her she wasn’t living in the Lord’s way and questioned who her friends were and if they followed the Lord. She said she didn’t know how to answer that, and they said it was a yes-or-no question. Meanwhile, she’s sobbing.”</p><p>Trending Today:</p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Man Walks Off Date After Woman Slurps Up 48 Oysters In One Sitting and Expects Him to Cover the Tab, Viral Video Shows</a></li><li><a href=#>University of Dallas Professor Allegedly Called Security on Black Student Listening to a Lecture on Computer Without Headphones</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Why Is Trump Risking ‘Fines and Even Jail Time’ to Speak Out Against Judge Tanya Chutkan, DA Fani Willis, and AG Letitia James Despite Signing Agreement Not to Lash Out?</a></li></ul><p>Rachel said her daughter, who has been dancing since she was 2 years old, is trained in hip-hop, has been hired to dance for Disney, and has even danced in that style during school performances.</p><p>Pierre’s decision left Rachel outraged, and the community likened the situation to the 1984 movie&nbsp;“Footloose.”&nbsp;During their meeting, Rachel said Pierre printed out Bible verses for her daughter, the Advocate reported, and on social media, people pointed out that Walker High School is a public institution.</p><p>“I am a Christian, “one user wrote in a local Facebook group, per the outlet. “I love that most teachers use our beliefs as a reference for the kids to go through life. But when you use it to bully and dictate children, it’s wrong.”</p><p>In a statement to the community&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a>&nbsp;on the high school’s official website earlier this month, Pierre acknowledged his actions and said he planned to speak with the family. He wrote that he would reinstate Timonet to her student government role and continue to endorse the student for her scholarship.</p><p>“Finally, during my conversation with Kaylee regarding the dance party, the subject of religious beliefs was broached by Kaylee and myself,” the statement said. “While that conversation was meant with the best intentions, I do understand it is not my responsibility to determine what students’ or others’ religious beliefs may be – that should be the responsibility of the individual.”</p><p>It continued: “As principal of Walker High School, I am faced daily with many difficult decisions for the interest of our students and employees that are never taken lightly. Please know that I always strive to place our students first in every decision. It is for that reason that I have taken this corrective action.”</p><p>However, Rachel said his statement and change of heart came too late and that her daughter’s scholarship deadline had already passed, as WAFB reported. The mother has reached out to attorneys about the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the report, Pierre asked to take leave for the remainder of the academic school year. Some parents and supports have worn shorts, saying, “Let the girl dance,” and have prompted other students to turn in twerking videos.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Read the original story here.</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e5BpZmpuX6G8trXSopinmV2dtqi0jKyaoaefoXq0sc2ipqtlp5bAbrzEp5iloaqasW6yzqtknZmemLavs4yaq2agn6KypLvMoqWgZZGbwaa%2BjKmYq6ypZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flouisiana-high-school-senior-was-penalized-for-dancing-at-homecoming-after-party.html&text=Told%20Her%20She%20Wasnt%20Living%20in%20the%20Lords%20Way%3a%20Students%20at%20Louisiana%20High%20School%20Reportedly&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flouisiana-high-school-senior-was-penalized-for-dancing-at-homecoming-after-party.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flouisiana-high-school-senior-was-penalized-for-dancing-at-homecoming-after-party.html&title=Told%20Her%20She%20Wasnt%20Living%20in%20the%20Lords%20Way%3a%20Students%20at%20Louisiana%20High%20School%20Reportedly" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flouisiana-high-school-senior-was-penalized-for-dancing-at-homecoming-after-party.html&title=Told%20Her%20She%20Wasnt%20Living%20in%20the%20Lords%20Way%3a%20Students%20at%20Louisiana%20High%20School%20Reportedly" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flouisiana-high-school-senior-was-penalized-for-dancing-at-homecoming-after-party.html&title=Told%20Her%20She%20Wasnt%20Living%20in%20the%20Lords%20Way%3a%20Students%20at%20Louisiana%20High%20School%20Reportedly" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flouisiana-high-school-senior-was-penalized-for-dancing-at-homecoming-after-party.html&description=Told%20Her%20She%20Wasnt%20Living%20in%20the%20Lords%20Way%3a%20Students%20at%20Louisiana%20High%20School%20Reportedly" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./esther-p-mendez.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Esther P.

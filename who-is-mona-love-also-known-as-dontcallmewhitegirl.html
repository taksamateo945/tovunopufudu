Her nationality is American while her ethnicity is mixed, with major elements of African-American and possibly Caucasian thrown in. Mona Love’s real name is Damona. She is however popularly known as Dontcallmewhitegirl i.e. don’t call me white girl, and the inspiration behind the name is obvious.</p><p>Mona Love is quite fair in complexion and this must have led to comments about her heritage. This would have also led many of her peers to dub her white girl. Such comments would in turn have led her to push back and ask people to not call her a white girl. Therefore, Mona Love is called Dontcallmewhitegirl because she doesn’t want to be referred to as a white girl as a result of her complexion.</p><h2><strong>She Spent Time in Jail for Fraud in her Late Teens</strong></h2><p>There is a paucity of information about Mona Love’s family. It is however known that she comes from poor family background and grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia. This was quite depressing. Even though Love was naturally talented and bright from a young age, her environment made her doubt her ability to achieve something tangible. Child prostitutes and drug users were a common sight in her neighborhood and this demoralized her.</p><p>She, therefore, became misguided as a youth and didn’t take school seriously. She eventually found herself in jail in her late teens for <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">fraud.</a> Mona Love was released from jail at the age of 21. She tried to pursue a legitimate way of life but this was made difficult by the fact that the system was unfavorable to ex-convicts. This made for some bleak years in her life.</p><h2><strong>She Started her Dontcallmewhitegirl Podcast in 2018</strong></h2><p>Throughout the bleak years of being in jail and dealing with life as an ex-convict, one thing that Mona Love never lost was her capacity to make people laugh. She was quite opinionated and would often put her point across in a funny way. As a result of this, her friends urged her to start a podcast.</p><p>She hesitated at first but she later commenced her Dontcallmewhitegirl podcast in 2018. The podcast steadily amassed impressive listenership over the years and this helped her to become a known figure in the hip-hop media community. She got to host shows such as Million Dollaz worth of Game as well as The Morning Hustle.</p><p>Mona Love’s podcast continues to thrive to this day. She usually offers her opinions on a wide range of topics including politics, pop culture, relationships, and dating. She has interviewed several notable <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">guests</a> on her podcast. She also has a segment for fans to call in and seek solutions for their problems.</p><h2><strong>Mona Love is now Famous across Social Media Platforms Such as YouTube and Tik Tok</strong></h2><p>Mona Love achieved viral fame in 2021 after an Instagram live clip of hers went viral. In that video, she utilized visual effects to look like a male and went on to give a detailed explanation of a sexual encounter that she had with a love interest. During the encounter, the man in question declared that he loved her and would want to marry her.</p><p>However, after the whole thing was up, Mona Love visited her love interest and tried to rekindle the flame. He however shot her down and questioned her as to why she was being weird. Love’s portrayal of the whole thing was so funny but the icing on the cake was when she mimicked her beau uttering the words – <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">why you being weird to me</a>?</p><p>It became a viral internet meme and led to numerous Tik Tok clips. Popular musicians, including Fabolous, also utilized the phrase in their songs. The whole thing made Love a social media sensation and she now has numerous fans on YouTube, Twitter, and Tik Tok. Her Twitter account has 65.9k followers while her Tik Tok account has at least 65k followers. Mona Love also had a large engagement on Instagram but she lost it after her account was banned.</p><h2><strong>Her Voice Can also be Heard on Jazmine Sullivan’s 2022 EP</strong></h2><p>Mona Love has become a popular personality in America. She has been interviewed on The Breakfast Club. She has also been covered by magazines such as Essence Magazine. Mona Love has also been tipped to replace Angela Yee when she leaves The Breakfast Club in 2022.</p><p>Mona Love’s voice can also be heard on Jazmine Sullivan’s 2022 EP, Heaux Tales, Mo Tales: The Deluxe Tracklist. The EP features four tracks and six interludes and one of the interludes is titled Mona’s tale. In it, Mona Love talks about her sexual performance and prowess.</p><h2><strong>Mona Love has Been Drawn into Controversy on Issues of Colourism and Domestic Violence</strong></h2><p>Mona Love has achieved so much but it has not come without some controversies. For instance, in December 2021, she interviewed model and influencer, Ari Fletcher, on her podcast. In the course of it, Fletcher tried to downplay the suffering of domestic violence victims. This led to a backlash from fans. Fletcher also lost a deal with Rihanna’s Fenty brand. Love escaped any major harm to her brand but it was a sobering moment.</p><p>Also in December 2021, Mona Love was interviewed on The Lip Service podcast and gave her thoughts on <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">colorism</a>. She tried to downplay the privilege that fair-skinned people have and many criticized her for it.</p><h2><strong>Mona Love has Has at Least One Child with Her Ex-Fiancé</strong></h2><p>Mona Love may be vocal and opinionated but she is quite taciturn about her private life. This makes it difficult to figure out the name and identities of her family members. It also makes it difficult to know the state of her Love life and who her boyfriend is. One thing that is however certain is that she has been in relationships over the years.</p><p>She ended up getting engaged and having a child with her fiancé. They lived together for some time before ultimately breaking up and going their separate ways. It is not confirmed if Mona Love has other children but Essence Magazine did refer to her “first child” meaning that it is reasonable to assume that she has more than one child.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmaln6OubrjOr5xmmZyovG63zaiup2WRqHqlu82tmpqknKKyuLTIrZygoaKhfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-mona-love-also-known-as-dontcallmewhitegirl.html&text=Who%20Is%20Mona%20Love%20also%20Known%20as%20Dontcallmewhitegirl%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-mona-love-also-known-as-dontcallmewhitegirl.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-mona-love-also-known-as-dontcallmewhitegirl.html&title=Who%20Is%20Mona%20Love%20also%20Known%20as%20Dontcallmewhitegirl%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-mona-love-also-known-as-dontcallmewhitegirl.html&title=Who%20Is%20Mona%20Love%20also%20Known%20as%20Dontcallmewhitegirl%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-mona-love-also-known-as-dontcallmewhitegirl.html&title=Who%20Is%20Mona%20Love%20also%20Known%20as%20Dontcallmewhitegirl%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-mona-love-also-known-as-dontcallmewhitegirl.html&description=Who%20Is%20Mona%20Love%20also%20Known%20as%20Dontcallmewhitegirl%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-lopez-told-what-is-the-secret-of-her-daily-rejuvenation-522148.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Lopez told what is the secret of her daily rejuvenation">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./frankie-valli-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Details About Children, Spouse, Songs, Height">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

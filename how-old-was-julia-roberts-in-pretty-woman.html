A lasting fan favorite of Roberts’ movies, one of the most frequently asked questions regarding the film concerns her age at the time of filming!</p><p><strong>The Georgia-born actress Julia Roberts was only 21-years-old when she was given the role of Vivian Ward in ‘Pretty Woman’. In the movie, Roberts’ character, a p****itute, is hired by a wealthy entrepreneur called Edward Lewis – played by Richard Gere – who then begins to fall in love with her.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>For Roberts – who won an Academy Award for her leading role in the film ‘Erin Brockovich’ a decade later in 2000 – landing a role in ‘Pretty Woman’ was no easy feat, and there would be more twists and turns to come before the film’s release.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Challenging Audition</h2><p>Roberts had to fight for her starring role in the movie and was asked to audition on <a href=# rel=noopener>two separate occasions</a> in order to land the role. Roberts was also up against stiff competition for the role, facing off against a host of A-list talent.&nbsp;</p><p>The movie’s director, Garry Marshall, is said to have originally wanted <a href=# rel=noopener>Meg Ryan</a> to play the role of Vivian, but when Ryan turned it down, Marshall turned his attention to Mary Steenburgen and Diane Lane. After conflicting schedules meant neither actress could take the role, Marshall’s people contacted Michelle Pfeiffer and Daryl Hannah, but both are believed to have also turned it down, this time it was on account of the script’s tone, with Hannah claiming the movie was “degrading to women”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And so, Roberts, who was neither well-known nor well-experienced at the time, was offered the role.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Casting the Movie’s Male Lead</h2><p>When it came to casting the movie’s male lead, Marshall had even more trouble seeking out the ideal thespian to play Edward Lewis. In fact, Roberts was screen-tested with 10 different actors, one of whom was <a href=# rel=noopener>Charles Grodin.</a></p><p>Much like the director’s first choices for the female lead, Richard Gere – who Marshall decided was the best option to play Edward – initially turned down the chance to star in the movie. In fact, he turned down the role <a href=# rel=noopener>multiple times</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a final attempt to get Gere – who is 18 years older than Roberts – to take on the role, Marshall <a href=# rel=noopener>flew Roberts out</a> to talk to Gere in person. An anecdote that has gone down in 90s Hollywood folklore details the encounter between the two and Roberts’ attempts to convince Gere to join the cast.</p><p>The story goes that while Gere was on the phone with Marshall, Roberts wrote <a href=# rel=noopener>“please say yes” </a>on a post-it and held it up in front of the Philadelphia-born actor. And the rest is history.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Pretty Woman’ Wasn’t Always a Romantic Comedy&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Interestingly, during the film’s production, ‘Pretty Woman’, or ‘$3,000’ as it was titled originally, was originally a <a href=# rel=noopener>darker</a>, grittier drama that explored the reality of sex work. In this early stage of production, the character of Vivian was a struggling drug addict whose relationship with Edward only operated on a carnal level, with the film’s working title referring to the amount Edward paid her.</p><p>In the original script, the film’s denouement was also <a href=# rel=noopener>significantly darker</a>. In this version, Vivian’s friend, Kit, dies from overdosing, and then later, Edward throws Vivian out of his car.&nbsp;</p><p>It was only after <a href=# rel=noopener>Disney stepped in</a> as producers did the movie change tack and become the light-hearted, comical romp that it is known and loved as today. Talk about a change of pace, right?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Julia Roberts and Richard Gere Today</h2><p>Even after the trialing casting process that could’ve easily seen a plethora of different actors take on the roles of Vivian and Edward, Roberts and Gere gelled in a markedly unique way and forged a <a href=# rel=noopener>chemistry</a> that has existed ever since.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>With the two showbiz legends starring together again in the 1999 movie ‘Runaway Bride’, there have been those in the media over the years who have speculated about a possible <a href=# rel=noopener>romance</a> between the two. All rumors, however, have been quashed.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Legacy of ‘Pretty Woman’</h2><p>Even after the challenges and questions about the tone of the film that Marshall and his cast overcame during the production of ‘Pretty Woman’, the film went on to gross a whopping $463 million worldwide and propel Roberts to international stardom.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqGmsGWfobFuw8CsZKOtnJ6ubr7Om5yrrKNitq95z6ucraypYsSwucCnZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-old-was-julia-roberts-in-pretty-woman.html&text=How%20Old%20Was%20Julia%20Roberts%20In%20%27Pretty%20Woman%27%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-old-was-julia-roberts-in-pretty-woman.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-old-was-julia-roberts-in-pretty-woman.html&title=How%20Old%20Was%20Julia%20Roberts%20In%20%27Pretty%20Woman%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-old-was-julia-roberts-in-pretty-woman.html&title=How%20Old%20Was%20Julia%20Roberts%20In%20%27Pretty%20Woman%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-old-was-julia-roberts-in-pretty-woman.html&title=How%20Old%20Was%20Julia%20Roberts%20In%20%27Pretty%20Woman%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-old-was-julia-roberts-in-pretty-woman.html&description=How%20Old%20Was%20Julia%20Roberts%20In%20%27Pretty%20Woman%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./prince-royce-phone-number.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Prince Royce Phone Number, WhatsApp Number Contact Number Mobile">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10029702-wwe-hall-of-famer-scott-hall-dies-at-age-63-following-3-heart-attacks.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="WWE Hall of Famer Scott Hall Dies at Age 63 Following 3 Heart Attacks | News, Scores, Highlights, St">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

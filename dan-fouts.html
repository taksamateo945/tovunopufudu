Quarterback who played the entirety of fifteen of his NFL season with his team, the San Diego Chargers, then became the color commentary to NFL matches on CBS.</p><p>The pair, along with&nbsp;the junior Seau&nbsp;each were able to retire their jerseys from the Chargers.</p><p>Born in San Francisco, Fouts attended Marin Catholic High School, located just north of San Francisco in Kentfield, California, for his two first years, and was the varsity starter as a sophomore in the fall of&nbsp;1966. He decided to transfer to St. Ignatius College Preparatory (San Francisco) for his final two years of high school, and graduated in 1969.</p><p>Selected in the third round with the 64th overall pick of the 1973 NFL Draft, Fouts helped lead the Chargers to the playoffs from 1979 to 1982 and twice to the AFC title game (1980 and 1981). He led the league four times in passing yards; ending his career with over 40,000, the third player to surpass that landmark.

The Chargers had an excellent offensive line which protected Fouts well, and included four-time Pro Bowler Ed White, five-time Pro Bowler Russ Washington, 3 time Pro Bowler Doug Wilkerson, Billy Shields and Don Macek. The Chargers led the league in passing yards an NFL record 6 consecutive years from 1978–1983 and again in 1985 under Fouts. They also led the league in total yards in offense 1980-1983 and 1985.</p><h2>Dan Fouts Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Dan Fouts is one of the <strong>richest Football Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Dan Fouts</b>'s net worth <strong>$10 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was not a popular athlete when he accepted an offer to attend Oregon’s University of Oregon; that changed when he was able to breaking records for 19 schools.</p><p align=justify>In the first year of his the game in 1993 the year 1993, he was inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p><p align=justify>Daniel Francis Fouts (born June 10, 1951) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for 15 years in the National Football League (NFL), spending his entire career with the San Diego Chargers (1973–1987). He led the NFL in passing yards four straight years from 1979 to 1982 and became the first player in history to throw for 4,000 yards in three consecutive seasons. The Chargers advanced to the AFC Championship Game twice during his career, but never reached the Super&nbsp;Bowl.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Fouts’s first few years in the league were inauspicious, but with the arrival of head coach Don Coryell in 1978 the Chargers’ fortunes turned. Yet it was two years earlier, with the arrival of Bill Walsh as the Chargers’ offensive coordinator, that the seeds of success were planted. Under Coryell, the Chargers were known as Air Coryell for the deep passing game and the involvement of the tight end as a key receiver. This required a tough, intelligent quarterback with a strong arm. Fouts fit the bill.</p><p>Despite going to the playoffs from 1979 through 1982 and playing in two AFC Championship Games, the Chargers never went to the Super Bowl under Fouts (although they went 7 years after his retirement). Usually this is attributed to poor defense and their unwillingness to run the ball. In Fouts’s prime the defense was not as stellar, but the running game became far better with the addition of Chuck Muncie, traded from New Orleans in 1980, and the drafting of James Brooks from Auburn in 1981. However, the defense suffered a loss when Fred Dean, an All-Pro sack specialist, was traded away to the San Francisco 49ers in 1981 in a contract dispute, and Dean would win UPI NFC Defensive Player of the Year (while playing in only 11 games) that year en route to a Super Bowl victory and help the 49ers to another Super Bowl title three years later. Dean would later be inducted into the Hall of Fame.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Dan Fouts height</b> <strong>6 ft 3 in</strong> Dan <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 3 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Fouts was not a mobile quarterback and the deep passing game led to many hits. Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh, a Chargers assistant coach in 1976, said “Dan Fouts had a cool, steel-like nerve and courage … He took a lot of beatings, a lot of pounding, but continued to play, hurt or otherwise. He played more physical football than anybody on his team, including the linebackers”. Rarely using the shotgun, Fouts would drop back from center and look for one of a bevy of great receivers. Wide receiver Charlie Joiner and tight end Kellen Winslow were the most famous, both now in the Hall of Fame, but John Jefferson and Wes Chandler, among others, were also key. Fouts’s passing enabled Winslow to lead the NFL in receptions twice (1980,1981), while Winslow (1982) and Lionel James (1985) led the AFC in receptions on another 2 combined occasions. James set the NFL record (since broken) in 1985 for receiving yards by a running back at 1,027. Jefferson became the first receiver to have 1,000&nbsp;yards receiving in each of his first three seasons in the NFL. Both Jefferson (1980) and Chandler (1982) led the NFL in receiving yards. Chandler’s 129&nbsp;yards receiving per game average in 1982 is still a league record. Both Jefferson (1978, 1980) and Chandler (1982) led the NFL in receiving TDs. In 1980, Winslow, Jefferson and Joiner became the first trio on the same team to have 1,000&nbsp;yards receiving in a season. When he retired after 1986, Joiner was the NFL’s all-time leader in receptions with 750.</p><p align=justify>Fouts set NFL season passing yardage records in three consecutive seasons from 1979 to 1981 with totals of 4,082, 4,715, and 4,802 yards. He broke Joe Namath’s professional record of 4,007 set in the American Football League in 1967, and Dan Marino broke Fouts’ record in 1984 with 5,084 yards. The Chargers in 1979 were the first AFC Western Division champion to run more passing plays (541) than rushing (481). In 1982, a season shortened to 9 games because of a strike, Fouts averaged 320&nbsp;yards passing per game, an NFL record that stood until Drew Brees averaged 342.25 in 2011. Highlights that season included back-to-back victories against the 1981 Super Bowl teams San Francisco (41-37) and Cincinnati (50-34) in which Fouts threw for over 400&nbsp;yards in each game to lead the Chargers to shootout victories. That season, he was named the NFL’s Most Valuable Player by Pro Football Writers Association and Newspaper Enterprise Association. He finished second in the Associated Press poll behind Mark Moseley, the only kicker to ever win the award. However, AP voted him the league’s Offensive MVP, as did Pro Football Weekly.</p><h2>Who is Dan Fouts Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Dan Fouts</strong> married to <strong>Jeri Martin </strong>.

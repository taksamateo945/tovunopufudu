Brand's career was impressive, featuring many dignified positions in athletic and academic administration.&nbsp; Through these experiences, he was able to bring integrity and respect to the forefront, both on the field and in the classroom. &nbsp;</p><p>Prior to his time as president of the NCAA, Brand served as Indiana University's 16th president from 1994-2002 and held the same position at the University of Oregon from 1989-1994.&nbsp; Earlier in his career, he spent time as an academic administrator at The Ohio State University, the University of Arizona, the University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Illinois-Chicago.</p><p>Brand was a traditionalist, always putting academics first and making sure schools did things the "right way."&nbsp; He was a pioneer in the marketability of academic programs and was always looking for ways to improve the well-being of student athletes. &nbsp;</p><p>His ideals and his character never wavered, sometimes creating a reputation of being overly stern and stubborn.&nbsp; Brand made no exceptions to rules, regulations, or policies, even if the situation involved the most robust of personalities.&nbsp; It is for this philosophy that Myles Brand will be remembered both positively...and negatively.</p><p>Exhibit A: Robert Montgomery Knight...you may know him as Bobby...The General.</p><p>Whether those close to Brand like it or not, he will forever go down in history as the man who fired Bobby Knight as Indiana University's head basketball coach.&nbsp; Brand ultimately started what is now a stalemate between Knight and Indiana's athletic department. &nbsp;</p><p>It was May 2000 when Brand made the tough decision to end Bob Knight's tenure as IU's basketball coach when a tape surfaced on TV showing Knight allegedly choking one of his players, the now infamous Neil Reed. &nbsp;</p><p>The aftermath had Brand and his wife being escorted to a safe house, away from the thousands of angry protesters outside his home in Bloomington, Indiana.&nbsp; His decision devastated Hoosier Nation, leaving the program's history in the dust and giving the helm to young Mike Davis. &nbsp;</p><p>Brand would leave Indiana University two years later, much to the enjoyment of the Hoosier faithful.&nbsp; Bob Knight's firing made people forget Brand's marketing and academic-related achievements at the university.&nbsp; Whether those sentiments were right or wrong, HE was the villain.</p><p>The news of Brand's death, while tragic and saddening, had me, as an IU alum, pondering one&nbsp; burning question: Is this somehow an omen that Bob Knight WILL return to Bloomington to accept his Indiana University Hall of Fame induction in-person?</p><p>Sure, it's kind of a ridiculous suggestion...but it's an interesting prospect to think about.&nbsp; After all, Bob Knight may still be in Bloomington as the head coach if Brand wasn't so stuck on the zero-tolerance policy. &nbsp;</p><p>Now, after studying and listening to Bob Knight for years, I have a good grasp of who he is as a person.&nbsp; I know that Knight is saddened by today's news and I know he certainly wouldn't do something today just to spite what happened in the past. &nbsp;</p><p>But I still wonder if today is at least an omen, a prophecy, telling the Hoosier faithful that their General, their idol will return on November 6th to finally take his rightful place in the Indiana University Hall of Fame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW5taW2FbsPHsmStoJViwbOtxqKaZpyVlsGpec6fZKaxnJrAbq7RmqWdZZOkwq2wjJucZpmeYryusc1mnaiqXZ28sL%2FInqlmppGptrC6</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f255988-why-the-tragic-death-of-myles-brand-could-be-an-omen-for-hoosier-nation.html&text=Why%20The%20Tragic%20Death%20Of%20Myles%20Brand%20Could%20Be%20An%20Omen%20For%20Hoosier%20Nation%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f255988-why-the-tragic-death-of-myles-brand-could-be-an-omen-for-hoosier-nation.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f255988-why-the-tragic-death-of-myles-brand-could-be-an-omen-for-hoosier-nation.html&title=Why%20The%20Tragic%20Death%20Of%20Myles%20Brand%20Could%20Be%20An%20Omen%20For%20Hoosier%20Nation%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f255988-why-the-tragic-death-of-myles-brand-could-be-an-omen-for-hoosier-nation.html&title=Why%20The%20Tragic%20Death%20Of%20Myles%20Brand%20Could%20Be%20An%20Omen%20For%20Hoosier%20Nation%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f255988-why-the-tragic-death-of-myles-brand-could-be-an-omen-for-hoosier-nation.html&title=Why%20The%20Tragic%20Death%20Of%20Myles%20Brand%20Could%20Be%20An%20Omen%20For%20Hoosier%20Nation%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f255988-why-the-tragic-death-of-myles-brand-could-be-an-omen-for-hoosier-nation.html&description=Why%20The%20Tragic%20Death%20Of%20Myles%20Brand%20Could%20Be%20An%20Omen%20For%20Hoosier%20Nation%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./issey-miyake-a-fashion-designer-who-saw-the-future-is-dead-at-84.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Issey Miyake, a Fashion Designer Who Saw the Future, Is Dead at 84">&larr;

This is because he was born on the 27th day of August 1999.&nbsp;His star sign is therefore Virgo. According to our findings, Tacoma was born in Mount Kisco, a town in Westchester County, New York, United States. It is reported that this was also where he was raised with his family.</p><p>It is not very clear how Tacoma was raised by his parents in his formative years as details about this time of his life are not available. However, his mother has often spoken fondly of her children and how much she loves and cares for them. From this, it can be deduced that Tacoma and his siblings received the best care possible especially because of his father’s status as a great musical genius.</p><h3><strong>Who is Tacoma Simmons’s Mother?</strong></h3><p>Tacoma Simmons’s mother is Tashera Simmons, an American born in New York on April 10, 1971. Tashera was the eldest of eight children born to her Panamanian-born mother and Brooklyn-born father.</p><p>Tashera grew up in the neighborhood of Yonkers, where her and her siblings were abandoned and had to fend for themselves. As a result, Tashera stepped up and became a maternal figure to her siblings, working odd jobs to provide for them.</p><h2><strong>Tacoma’s Father, DMX was One of The World’s Biggest Rap Legends</strong></h2><p>DMX was a legendary figure in the hip-hop community and significantly impacted the music industry. His unique style of rapping and powerful stage presence set him apart from others in the genre. He was known for his gruff voice, aggressive delivery, and intense lyrics that often touched upon themes such as struggle, street life, and spirituality.</p><p>His debut album, “It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot,” was well-received by fans and critics alike and established him as a force to be reckoned with in the rap world. The album’s success was followed by his best-selling album, “And Then There Was X,” which further solidified his status as one of the top rappers of the time.</p><p>In addition to his music, DMX was also known for his acting career, which included roles in films such as “Belly,” “Romeo Must Die,” and “Exit Wounds.” He even starred in his own reality television series, “DMX: Soul of a Man.” This showcased his personal life and gave fans a deeper insight into the man behind the music. DMX was a unique talent and will forever be remembered as a pioneering figure in the world of hip-hop.</p><h2><strong>Tacoma’s Parents Were Married For 14 Years</strong></h2><p>Tacoma Simmons’ father, DMX, was married to his mother, an American woman called Tashera Simmons. As a matter of fact, they were actually married for about 14 years before things fell apart. According to our findings, DMX and Tashera were actually childhood friends who became lovers. The two of them met when they were both just 11 years old and developed a close bond over the years.</p><p>When they were both 18, they decided to take their relationship to the next level and started dating. Eventually, they got married in 1999 and enjoyed some really blissful times together. Their marriage lasted for 14 years before breaking down in 2014. During this time they raised a family and built a life together. However, the marriage ultimately ended in divorce, but they remained friends after that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/tashera.jpg><h2><strong>What Happened Between Tacoma Simmons’ Parents?</strong></h2><p>DMX and Tashera Simmons’ relationship was marked by instances of abuse and mistreatment, which ultimately led to their separation. In 2012, the couple agreed to participate in the reality show “Couple’s Rehab” in an effort to fix their relationship, but the show only served to highlight the issues and the need for them to part ways.</p><p>DMX’s behavior on the show was particularly troubling, as he was recorded yelling at Tashera and saying that he never wanted to get married. These actions caused Tashera to request a divorce, which was not a scripted part of the show. This unfortunate situation was a stark contrast to the relationship they had built, having met when they were 11 years old and starting dating at 18. They eventually got divorced in 2014, parting ways after 14 years of marriage.</p><p>Despite the negative aspects of their relationship, Tashera shared in an interview with Essence that she wouldn’t change anything as she learned a lot from the experience.</p><h2><strong>How Many Siblings Does Tacoma Simmons Have?</strong></h2><p>Tacoma Simmons has three siblings. According to our findings,&nbsp;DMX and Tashera Simmons had four children together during their 11-year marriage. Xavier, the oldest, was born in 1992. Tacoma, the second child, was born in 1999. Sean, the third child, was born in 2002. The youngest, Praise Mary Ella, was born in 2005.</p><p>Tacoma, who is the second child in the family, reportedly had a great time growing up with the rest of his siblings. They are quite close today as the family shares a close bond mainly due to their mother’s efforts to being everyone together. However, it’s not very clear what the rest of Tacoma’s siblings are up to now at the moment.</p><h2><strong>Tacoma Has Several Step-Siblings</strong></h2><p>It is also noteworthy that, apart from his full-blooded siblings, Tacoma Simmons also has several step-brothers and step-sisters who were born to his father by other women. The truth is that, during his marriage to Tashera, DMX had several extramarital affairs that resulted in children. He had a daughter named Sasha with Patricia Trejo, who later sued him for $1 million in unpaid child support. The case was resolved in 2013 through a settlement.</p><p>DMX was also involved in a legal dispute with Monique Wayne, who claimed that he was the father of her son. The claims were confirmed through genetic testing, and DMX was initially ordered to pay Wayne $1.5 million, but the judgment was later vacated. He also had children with Yadira Borrego, his fiancée Desiree Lindstrom, and later, twin boys with Pebbles Junell. In total, DMX is reported to have fathered about 17 children with 11 mothers.</p><p>So, by extension, Tacoma has about 13 different step-siblings. It is not clear how well he relates with all the other children that were born to his father.</p><h2><strong>Tacoma’s Father Died When He Was 21 Years Old</strong></h2><p>Sadly, DMX is no more. The renowned rapper died in 2021 when Tacoma was about 21 years old. On April 2, 2021, DMX was rushed to the White Plains Hospital in New York after suffering a heart attack at his home. It was reported that the heart attack may have been caused by a drug overdose. The following day, his attorney confirmed that DMX was on life support and that the cause of his heart attack was unknown.</p><p>Later that night, DMX suffered from cerebral hypoxia, which resulted in oxygen deprivation to the brain, and paramedics attempted to revive him. His former manager, Nakia Walker, reported that DMX was in a vegetative state with lung and brain failure and no current brain activity.</p><p>On April 6, DMX’s manager, Steve Rifkind, confirmed that the rapper was in a coma and was to undergo tests on his brain function. Unfortunately, DMX’s death was confirmed on April 9. The rapper’s passing was a great loss to the music community and his fans. It also greatly affected his family, including Tacoma Simmons, who was said to have been close to his father.</p><h2><strong>What Does Late DMX’s Son, Tacoma Simmons, Do For A Living?</strong></h2><p>Unlike his father, who was very outspoken and a really public figure, Tacoma Simmons is a very private person. For this reason, not much is known about what he does with his life at the moment.</p><p>This notwithstanding, several reports have revealed that Tacoma has established himself as a talented musical composer and manager in the music industry. In fact, different reports show that Tacoma is an employee at Guitar Center, a well-known chain of retailers that specializes in selling musical instruments and gear.</p><p>This position at Guitar Center highlights Tacoma’s expertise in the music industry, as well as his passion for helping others find the right instruments to bring their musical ideas to life. It’s evident that Tacoma has inherited his father’s love and talent for music. By pursuing a career in the music industry and following in his father’s footsteps, Tacoma is carrying on DMX’s legacy and making a name for himself in the music world.</p><p>With his talent, drive, and passion, there is no doubt that Tacoma has a bright future ahead of him in the world of music.</p><h2><strong>Tacoma Simmons’ Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Tacoma Simmons has a net worth estimated to be around $100,000 in 2023. He was last reported to have been an employee at Guitar Center, a retail chain that specializes in selling musical instruments. This, among other endeavors, is believed to be the source of his net worth.</p><h3><strong>Did Tacoma Simmons Inherit DMX’s net worth after his death?</strong></h3><p>DMX died with a net worth of $-1 million, so there was nothing to be inherited by Tacoma Simmons. However, he was selected alongside his mother Tashera and siblings Xavier Simmons and Sean Simmons to be the managers of DMX’s estate.</p><h2><strong>Where is Tacoma Simmons Now?</strong></h2><p>Tacoma Simmons is in New York, where he is believed to reside and work. As earlier mentioned, he works at Guitar Center and is a music composer. He will be hoping to one day make strides in the music business just like his father managed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571Kxmpp2VqXq1rcKopJplo566rrvNrGStoJViuaLAxGabprCjYsCwuo4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeet-tacoma-simmons-the-late-dmxs-son.html&text=Meet%20Tacoma%20Simmons%2c%20the%20Late%20DMXs%20Son&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-tacoma-simmons-the-late-dmxs-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-tacoma-simmons-the-late-dmxs-son.html&title=Meet%20Tacoma%20Simmons%2c%20the%20Late%20DMXs%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeet-tacoma-simmons-the-late-dmxs-son.html&title=Meet%20Tacoma%20Simmons%2c%20the%20Late%20DMXs%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-tacoma-simmons-the-late-dmxs-son.html&title=Meet%20Tacoma%20Simmons%2c%20the%20Late%20DMXs%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-tacoma-simmons-the-late-dmxs-son.html&description=Meet%20Tacoma%20Simmons%2c%20the%20Late%20DMXs%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./suresh-raina.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Suresh Raina- Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Ethnicity">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./will-pay-later-letters-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will pay later letters">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

What made him famous was his defence using a new term called 'affluenza', referring to a disease affecting wealthy spoilt children that prevents them from thinking about consequences. This led him to earn the name, Affluenza Teen.

He was born on the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">11th of April, 1997</a>, in Tarrant County, Texas, United States. He is currently 24 years old, but he will be turning 25 years old on the 11th of April 2022. Ethan Couch's parents are Fredrick and Tonya Couch. Fred and Tanya married in 1997 and parted ways in 2007.</p><h3>Ethan Couch's accident</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/9890ea4a477a77d3.jpg><p class=align-left>According to Ethan Couch's documentary, on the evening of the 15th of July, 2013, he was seen on surveillance stealing beer from a Walmart store. At the time, Ethan was 16 years old and was driving his father's red Ford F-30 with seven passengers inside.</p><p class=align-left>About an hour later, he was driving at 110km/hour on the designated 64km/hour rural, two-lane Burleson-Retta Road. It was when he ran into Breanna Mitchell's <a href=#>sport</a> utility vehicle, who had been involved in a separate car accident, and was using Hollie Boyles' phone to call for help.</p><p class=align-left>Couch's truck flipped over and struck a tree.</p><p class=align-left>Ethan Couch's victims were nine in number, four of whom passed away. Their names were 43-year-old Pastor Brian Jennings, 52-year-old Hollie Boyles and her 21-year-old daughter Shelby Boyles, and 24-year-old Breanna Mitchell.</p><p class=align-left>Ethan and seven of his friends, all of whom had not put their seatbelts on, survived. Two of Jenning's children survived, and two people in a hit Volks Wagen survived.</p><h3>Ethan Couch's penalty</h3><p class=align-left>Three hours later, the scene was covered in a pool of blood. Ethan tested for 0.24% blood alcohol content, three times the legal limit for adult drivers, and positive for marijuana and diazepam.</p><p class=align-left>He was charged with four counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault, and the prosecutor was seeking 20 years imprisonment. However, Miller, a psychologist, argued that Ethan Couch's affluenza, a psychological malaise supposedly affecting wealthy young people, was to blame. He argued that Ethan could not think of the consequences of his action because his parents, who are <a href=#>wealthy people</a>, had taught him money buys privilege.</p><p class=align-left>This sparked a lot of outrage online, and the fact that he was sentenced to 10 years probation, subsequently ordering him to go to a mental facility, a <a href=#>sentence </a>which many thought was lenient.</p><p class=align-left>In 2015, a video showing how much Couch was drinking surfaced, and he became the subject of a search. He and his mother tried to flee to Mexico but were arrested, and Ethan was sentenced to 2 years in prison and got out in 2018.</p><p class=align-left>In 2020, he was taken back to prison for violating his probation but was released a day later.</p><h3>What has happened to Ethan Couch?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/960c11f6cc9be003.jpeg><p class=align-left>Ethan Couch today lives in his house, with probation not to drink any alcohol. He is still under his 10-year probation and is under <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rehabilitation</a>.</p><h3>Where is Tonya Couch today?</h3><p class=align-left>In 2019, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tonya</a>, incarcerated in the Tarrant County Jail for a probation violation, said she has been unemployed for more than a year. Due to the notoriety derived from her legal entanglements, she cannot get or keep a job. Additionally, she has been in and out of jail (failed drug tests) since she helped her son flee to Mexico in 2016.</p><h3>What happened to Ethan Couch's father?</h3><p class=align-left>The Couch family seems very controversial as Fred, a <a href=#>businessman</a>, was charged with an alleged <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">choking incident </a>involving a girlfriend. Additionally, according to Texas prosecutors, the father of the so-called "affluenza teen" has been charged with assault stemming from an incident in which he allegedly choked his girlfriend.</p><p class=align-left>A Tarrant County grand jury declined to indict affluenza dad, Fred Couch, on the domestic assault charge.</p><p class=align-left>Ethan Couch is an example of how things could go wrong if parents do not raise their children correctly. Although the law caught up with him, many still believe that the punishment was not enough for the four lives he took.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong></p><p class=align-left><a href=# title>We </a>recently published an article about <a href=#>Justin Combs's biography</a>.
